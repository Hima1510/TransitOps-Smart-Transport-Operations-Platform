## 📌 Overview

**TransitOps** is a full-stack fleet and transport operations platform that helps organizations manage their entire mobility operation from a single, real-time dashboard. It replaces spreadsheets and disconnected tools with one system that fleet managers, drivers, safety officers, and financial analysts can all rely on — each with a view tailored to their role.

Built for **[Hackathon Name] 2026**, TransitOps demonstrates how a lean, well-architected full-stack app can solve a real operational problem: fragmented visibility across vehicles, people, and money in a transport business.

> 💡 **Problem it solves:** Fleet operators today juggle spreadsheets, WhatsApp groups, and paper logs to track vehicle health, driver licensing, trip status, and fuel spend — leading to missed maintenance windows, expired licenses, and poor cost visibility. TransitOps centralizes all of it with real-time KPIs and proactive alerts.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/transitops.git
cd transitops

cd backend && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install
```

### 2. Seed Demo Data

```bash
cd backend
npm run seed
```

### 3. Run the Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```
Backend runs at **http://localhost:3001**

### 4. Run the Frontend

In a new terminal:

cd frontend
npm run dev
```
Frontend runs at **http://localhost:5173**

### 5. Health Check

Confirm the backend is live:
```
http://localhost:3001/api/health
```

### Using a Different Port (Windows / PowerShell)

```powershell
cd backend
$env:PORT = "3002"
npm run dev

cd ..\frontend
$env:VITE_BACKEND_PORT = "3002"
npm run dev
```
